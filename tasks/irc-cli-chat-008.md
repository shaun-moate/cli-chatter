# Task: Add User Authentication

## User Story
As a user, I want to authenticate with the server so that I can access restricted channels or features.

## Acceptance Criteria
Given server requires auth,
When I provide username and password on connect,
Then I am authenticated and can proceed.

## Dependencies / Assumptions / Risks
- Assumption: Server has auth mechanism.
- Risk: Security; mitigation: Use secure input for passwords.
- Dependency: Possibly crypto package for hashing.

## Test Notes & Observability Hooks
- Manual test: Authenticate with test credentials.
- Unit test: Test auth flow.
- Observability: Log auth attempts (without exposing credentials).

## Effort
M (Security sensitive, estimated 12-20 hours)
