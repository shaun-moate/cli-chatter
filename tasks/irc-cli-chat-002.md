# Task: Implement Connection to Chat Server

## User Story
As a user, I want to connect to a chat server so that I can participate in real-time communication.

## Acceptance Criteria
Given a valid server address and port,
When I provide the connection command with server details,
Then the app establishes a TCP/WebSocket connection and confirms success.

## Dependencies / Assumptions / Risks
- Assumption: Server supports standard IRC protocol or WebSocket.
- Risk: Network failures; mitigation: Add retry logic and error handling.
- Dependency: Use net package or gorilla/websocket.

## Test Notes & Observability Hooks
- Unit test: Mock server connection.
- Integration test: Connect to a test server.
- Observability: Log connection status and errors.

## Effort
M (Involves network programming, estimated 8-16 hours)
