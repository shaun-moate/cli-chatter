# Task: Develop Basic Command-Line Interface

## User Story
As a user, I want a basic CLI for input and output so that I can interact with the chat app easily.

## Acceptance Criteria
Given the app is running,
When I type commands or messages,
Then they are processed and output is displayed clearly in the terminal.

## Dependencies / Assumptions / Risks
- Assumption: Go's bufio for input.
- Risk: Terminal compatibility; mitigation: Test on multiple platforms.

## Test Notes & Observability Hooks
- Manual test: Interact with the CLI.
- Observability: Add debug mode for input/output logs.

## Effort
S (Basic I/O, estimated 4-8 hours)
