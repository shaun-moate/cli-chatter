# Task: Conduct Testing and Bug Fixes

## User Story
As a developer, I want to test the app thoroughly so that it meets quality standards before release.

When I run unit tests, integration tests, and manual tests,
Then all tests pass and critical bugs are fixed.

## Dependencies / Assumptions / Risks

- Risk: Undiscovered bugs; mitigation: Use code coverage tools.

## Test Notes & Observability Hooks
- Run test suite.
- Manual QA on different platforms.
- Observability: Integrate logging and monitoring.
