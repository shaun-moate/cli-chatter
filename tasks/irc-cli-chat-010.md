# Task: Implement File Sharing Feature

## User Story
As a user, I want to share files in channels so that I can collaborate on documents or code.

## Acceptance Criteria
Given connected to channel,
When I use /sendfile command with file path,
Then the file is uploaded and shared in the channel.

## Dependencies / Assumptions / Risks
- Assumption: Server supports file uploads.
- Risk: Large files; mitigation: Add size limits.
- Dependency: Possibly additional libraries.

## Test Notes & Observability Hooks
- Manual test: Share a small file.
- Unit test: Test file handling.
- Observability: Log file transfers.
