# Task: Initialize Go Project and Basic CLI Structure

## User Story
As a developer, I want to initialize the Go project with a basic CLI structure so that I can start building the IRC CLI chat app.

## Acceptance Criteria
Given the Go environment is set up,
When I run `go mod init` and create the main.go file with a basic input loop,
Then the project compiles and runs, displaying a prompt for user input.

## Dependencies / Assumptions / Risks
- Assumption: Go 1.19+ is installed on the system.
- Risk: Potential issues with Go installation; mitigation: verify Go version in CI.

## Test Notes & Observability Hooks
- Manual test: Execute the binary and confirm the prompt appears.
- Observability: Add console logs for initialization.

## Effort
S (Straightforward project setup, estimated 2-4 hours)
