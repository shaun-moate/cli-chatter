# IRC-Inspired CLI Chat App

## Problem Statement
In today's development environments, developers and system administrators often need a lightweight, command-line based chat tool for real-time communication, similar to IRC, without the overhead of graphical interfaces or complex setups. Existing solutions are either too heavy or not tailored for CLI workflows.

## User Personas
- **Developer**: A software engineer who collaborates on code remotely and needs quick communication during development.
- **System Administrator**: An IT professional managing servers who prefers CLI tools for efficiency.
- **Open-Source Contributor**: Someone contributing to projects who wants a simple way to discuss issues in channels.

## Goals and Objectives
- Provide a simple, efficient CLI chat application inspired by IRC.
- Enable real-time messaging, channel support, and basic user management.
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility and minimal resource usage.

## Success Metrics
- User adoption: 1000 active users within 6 months.
- Engagement: Average session time > 30 minutes.
- Performance: < 50ms latency for message delivery.
- Feedback: 4+ star rating on relevant platforms.

## Key Features
### Must Have
- Connect to a chat server.
- Send and receive messages in real-time.
- Basic command-line interface for input/output.

### Should Have
- Support for multiple channels.
- Private messaging.
- User authentication.

### Could Have
- File sharing.
- Message history.
- Custom themes.

### Won't Have
- Video/audio calls.
- Graphical user interface.
- Integration with social media.

## Non-goals
- Building a full IRC server; focus on client-side.
- Supporting advanced IRC features like bots or scripts.
- Mobile app versions.

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Security Risks**: Potential for data breaches. Mitigation: Implement encryption and follow Go security best practices.
- **Performance Issues**: High latency on slow networks. Mitigation: Optimize network code and test on various connections.
- **Adoption Challenges**: Users preferring GUI tools. Mitigation: Provide tutorials and highlight CLI benefits.

## Dependencies
- Go standard library (net, bufio, etc.).
- External: github.com/gorilla/websocket for WebSocket support (if needed).
- No heavy dependencies to keep it lightweight.

## Timeline
- **Month 1**: Core development (connection, messaging).
- **Month 2**: Add channels and private messages.
- **Month 3**: Testing, bug fixes, and release MVP.
- **Month 4-6**: Add optional features, gather feedback.
